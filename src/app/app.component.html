    <b>Important message to the corrector:</b> 
    <p>
        Please notice that I was not able to implement the features related to the scores because of (I think)
        a dysfunction of the API /games of the API provider (rapidapi). Indeed, the filter on "team_ids" does not have any effect...
        You can check by yourself by trying on their own website (https://rapidapi.com/theapiguy/api/free-nba). 
    </p>
    <p>
        To get around, I tried to fetch all data without filtering the API, but there are so much data, that it was not a solution.
        Hope we can talk about those features during the interview...
    </p>
    <p>
        In consequence, everywhere the feature is missing in the template, I replace it by the following sentence <b>"NOT IMPLEMENTED FEATURE"</b> so that you can identify them.
